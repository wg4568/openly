			<h2>
			When you connect to a website from school or work, before you can view the page the network checks to see if the site is on a list of websites created by the admin. If it is on the list, you will not be allowed to connect. Most wifi networks, however, do not have this filtering. This allows you to send the web address to me, I download it from my home, and send it back to you! This is pretty much how the whole system works, but instead of me doing all this manually, it is automatic.</h2>
